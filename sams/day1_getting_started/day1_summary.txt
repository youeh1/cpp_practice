# runtime error vs compiled error

-  compile error
  : detected when the code is compiled
  : compile cannot be completed

-  runtime error
  : happened when the executable is run
  : can happen when divided by zero
  : running out of memory
  : dereferencing a null pointer
  : trying to open a file that isn't there
